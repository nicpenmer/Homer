Welcome to Homer, a relocation services app that helps you find out where you belong. It helps you find home. 

Firstly, the user is prompted to create a username or login using an existing user name. 

Then the user lands on the user landing page, with their name and user info and their last result (if this is your first time, then there will be a "no results" message in the result part. 

Then the user is prompted to take the quiz, 10 simple questions to find out where you truly belong.

Then the user is returned a list of cities, that are ordered with best match to least match. 

And then each city in the list will link to its own info page.
